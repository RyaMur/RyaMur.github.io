            <p>Hi, my name is Ryan Murphy and I am providing this cover letter in regards to the employment opportunity VORTX is providing.</p>
            <p>
                I have always had an interest in design and technology and am currently pursuing that interest in the form of finishing an
                Associate degree in web development.  I have experience with HTML, CSS, responsive design, Bootstrap, Visual Studio, Photoshop,
                InDesign and Illustrator and have worked with Git and GitHub.  I also have some experience with JavaScript, jQuery, and SEO methods.
                Before starting the web development degree I had been working on a computer support/IT degree and am very familiar with the Microsoft
                suite as well as being comfortable working with computers in general.  More than this I have a real and true desire to learn and grow
                in the fields of design and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have had many years of experience in the field of customer service and have always excelled at reading the mood and intent
                of a customer and then interacting with them accordingly. I have always been a quick learner and a diligent worker which has often led
                to me being assigned additional responsibilities.  I want to thank you for your time and consideration; I am looking forward to hearing
                back from you.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
