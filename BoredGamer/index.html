         <h2>&mdash; Ryan Murphy</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>For many years I spent my recreational time immersed in the world of videogaming.  The characters that I could be, the places
      I could go and the things that I could do fascinated me.  While I still have fond memories of those times, the fact remains that 
      they were solitary adventures and lacked true social interaction.
      </p>
      <p>My desire for something allowing more interaction with friends and family led me to a new interest, the boardgaming hobby.  
      While many of the  board games that I enjoy still have the elements of interesting characters, fantastic places and exciting 
      quests; the board game format allows me to share these experiences with others making them feel somehow more genuine and lasting.
      </p>
      <p>I have created this site as an outlet for sharing my thoughts and experiences with boardgaming.  If you would like to receive 
      information and updates feel free to sign up, and if you just want to drop me a line please do.  And as always,<br>
      <strong><em>Happy Gaming!</em></strong>

      	<h2><strong>New Review</strong></h2>
         <p>New review up for <em>"Bang!"</em>.  Player elimination in this game can be a drag, and you really need at least five people 
         despite what the game says, but how many games let you slip into the role of a six-shooting desperado in the Old West?

        <h2><strong>Saturday, January 26th 5:00PM-11:00PM</strong></h2>
          <p>It's time again for the monthly open game night at the Ashland library.  Take the time to swing by and check out some 
          games while meeting other gamers.

      	<h2><strong>Updated Game List</strong></h2>
         <p>Christmas was pretty good to me this year so I've been able to add a few extra games to the list, and some others which I 
         simply had not put in yet(Christmas wasn't that good).  Expect some new reviews to be going up fairly soon.

      	<h2><strong>Sunday, May 27th 2:00PM</strong></h2>
         <p>Our weekly gaming group is getting together again.  This week we'll be checking out a new cooperative superhero card game,
         <em>"Sentinels of the Multiverse"</em>.

      	<h2><strong>New Review</strong></h2>
         <p>Just put up a new review for <em>"Merchants and Marauders"</em>.  The game has multiple win paths, great player interaction 
         and an awesome piratical theme.  Do yourself a favor and go check it out.

      	<h2><strong>Sunday, May 20th 2:00PM</strong></h2>
         <p>Our weekly gaming group is getting together again.  This week we'll be playing one of this year's most popular deckbuilding
         games, <em>"Dominion"</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      	<h2><strong>New Review</strong></h2>
         <p>Just put up a new review for <em>"Runebound"</em>.  While the game can drag on a bit towards the end, it's still an 
         incredible amount of fun watching your hero grow continually stronger while travelling the land and finding new weapons and 
         armor to smack around some monster scum.
