The Appalachian Trail, sometimes known as the AT, is a hiking trail in the eastern U.S. that extends between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine, making it approximately 2,181 miles long. Along the way, the trail passes through the states of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The majority of the trail passes through wilderness areas, although some portions pass through towns and roads, and cross rivers.

The Appalachian Trail is famous for its many hikers, some of whom, called thru-hikers, attempt to hike it in its entirety in a single season. Many books, memoirs, web sites and fan organizations are dedicated to this pursuit.
